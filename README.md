# Quotes

> “What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.”
*― J.D. Salinger*

> “A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people.”
*― Thomas Mann*
